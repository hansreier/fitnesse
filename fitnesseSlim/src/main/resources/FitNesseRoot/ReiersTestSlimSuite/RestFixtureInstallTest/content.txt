!contents -R2 -g -p -f -h
!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}

The test calls itself with Rest calls!
---------------------------
Note:
The below variables could be used, to make the test not dependent of location in FITNESSE tree
The problem is that Fitnesse believes this is a new page or link
Using !-!- -! -! as protection does not help since then the symbol is treated as plain text
You are welcome to find a solution.

#${PAGE_NAME}
#${PAGE_PATH}
