Download Fitnesse
http://docs.fitnesse.org/FrontPage
Download fitnesse.standalone.jar to a catalog on your PC
Type java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar
http://localhost
The fitnesse wiki server is started
You can browse it
We are not going to use this test installation directly so 
stop it with Ctrl C.

download Maven build tool
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

M2_HOME windows environment variable must point to maven installation directory.
Need also to set path to Maven installation directory/bin

To verify that installed mvn --version i cmd

-------------------------D-----------------------------------

If desired download git (alternative use enclosed zipped project contents)
...to be able to clone project from github. 
Since it requires some knowledge and time to be used to git (I will not give instruction), you can skip it.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

-------------------------E--------------------------------

Download source code:

www.github.com/hansreier/fitnesse contains source code, or unzip fitnesse.zip
Clone or download reposistory. Copy Link. Go to directory e.g. C:/git
enter git clone https://github.com/hansreier/fitnesse.git in Windows cmd Window.
Alternative use git bash window (installed when installing git). 

A catalog with the source code C:/git/fitnesse is created. 

The alternative is to unzip fitnesse.zip into that directory,

--------------------------F--------------------------------

download Intellij Ultimate.
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
64 bit launcher, Create .java associtions.

Run Intellij, Config or installation folder. 
Recommendation: Somewhere on the C disk, not Program Files.
Usually: Do not import settings.
Default Plugins: Easiest is to enable all
Build Tools: At least Maven
Version Controls, git, github
Evaluate (30 days or licence)

--------------------------------G----------------------------

Open project in Intellij
C;/git/fitnesse

But the various projects (modules) is not detected properly doing this.
Usually in Intellij projects there is one main project with several modules that is loaded at once
Since in this course the modules are independent Java projects we have to 
set up each project individually as described below:

--------------------------------H----------------------------

Install fitnesse plugin first

File, settings, plugins, Search for Fitnesse
Select Plugin FitNesse (George Shakhnazaryan...)
Install
Restart IDE

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7908-fitnesse

https://github.com/gshakhn/idea-fitnesse/wiki/Configuring-the-plugin

---------------------------------I---------------------------
car is a java project
Right click on pom.xml and +Add as maven project.
Select clean and install in the maven window to the upper right of the IDE
Select JDK if required
a simple project with som JUnit tests
select test to run the unit tests

--------------------------------J-----------------------------

YOU CAN WAIT WITH THE REST OF THE INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THE WORKSHOP
(Or try it if you want)


fitnesseSimpleFitTest is a Java project
Right click on pom.xml and +Add as maven project.
Select clean and install in the maven window to the upper right of the IDE
Select JDK if required

Run/Debug Configurations in Intellij
Templates
FitNesse
FitNesse Root directory: FitNesseRoot
Working directory: C:\git\fitnesse\fitnesse
Use classpath of module:fitnesseSimpleSlimTest (Does not work for the fit test)
Use FintNesse.jar bundlet with the plugin (recommended): Yes

Run/Debug Configurations in Intellij
Name: fitnesseSimpleFitTest
FitNesse Root directory: FitNesseRoot
Working directory: C:\git\fitnesse\fitnesse
Wiki page name: ReiersTestFit
Use classpath of module: fitNesseSimpleFitTest

------------------------------K------------------------------

fitnesseSimpleSlimTest is a Java project
Right click on pom.xml and +Add as maven project.
Select clean and install in the maven window to the upper right of the IDE

-------------------------------L-----------------------------

fitnesseSlim is a Java project that also includes Fitnesse Wiki pages.
The Java fixtures is actually the same as in fitnesseSimpleFitTest and fitnesseSimpleSlim test
This setup is more complex. The advantage is the Fitnesse tests can be run as JUnit tests in this setup.

NOT RECOMMENDED: Right click on pom.xml and +Add as maven project.  Syntext highligting in editor does not work properly after this. 
(Due to multiple instances of the same classes)
RECOMMENDED:
Enter File, open  in Intellij, point to the pom file, open the project in a separate Window.

Select clean and install in the maven window to the upper right of the IDE
Select JDK if required
Run maven clean install (in maven window)
Run MultiplicationTest in fitnesseSlim - A regular unit test (no Fitnesse)
Run test in Fitnessse.junit - runs all the Fitnesse tests as unit tests.
Run fitnesse.bat - starts fitnesse server on 8081
http://localhost:8081 and you enter the Fitnesse Wiki GUI in the usual way.

-----------------------------M-------------------------------

fitnesse project contains the wiki pages for fitnesseSimpleFitTest and fitNesseSimpleSlimTest.
Running start.bat starts the Fitnesse wiki server. 
Note: It is possibe that the plugins Bacth Scripts support and CMD support in Intellij is needed to install.
Intellij should warn about this trying to run the file.
http://localhost:8080 to enter the Fitnesse wiki server.
Run ReierTestFit and ReiersTestSlim to test that stuff is working. 
-Test in menu bar runs the test
-Edit: Edit the wiki text of the test
-FitNesse: Home
